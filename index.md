# About Me

My name is Diego Rivero Vazquez and I am a senior at the University of Washington. This page shares some information about myself and my academic interests! 

## Academics

I am a senior double majoring in English and Political Science. I am creating this site as part of my class on Software Documentation, **ENGL 396**. Currently, I am in the process of waiting to hear back from graduate school admissions, as in the fall I applied to PhD programs for English. My goal after graduation is to attend grad school in the following autumn and begin working towards becoming a professor! 

These have been some of my favorite classes I have taken at UW througout my four years!

### Current Reads

This winter, I am reading John Steinbeck's *In Dubious Battle*, Thomas Pynchon's *The Crying of Lot 49*, Karen Tei Yamashita's *Through the Arc of the Rainforest*, and Rabih Alameddine's *Koolaids*, as a combination of novels I have to read for classes and books I am picking up for personal pleasure. This reading list has been organized around the topic of ***postmodernism***, and while a singular concrete and conclusive defintion is difficult to attain, these lines from William Butler Yeats' poem, "The Second Coming," highlight the main concern of postmodernism that I am fascinated by, that of global crisis: 

> "Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold / 
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world"
